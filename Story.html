                                I am 20 years old. I am studying at CTU Training Solutions.<br />
                                I was born and raised in the Free State, Harrismith. I used to live in England<br />
                                when I was much younger. I would like to go back there once more<br />
                                and experience it, again. I have so many memories connected to that special place.<br />
                                <br />
                                I completed my school career at Harriston. I completed my Matric year in 2015.<br />
                                I carried on studying to persue my dream, to try and become a well-known software developer. <br />
